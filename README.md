# 🥒 Pickle Rick's Rug Roaster

A cynical Gemini CLI extension that analyzes crypto projects and delivers a scathing roast about their potential as a rug pull. Wubba lubba dub dub!

## What is this?

You pulled me into this dimension of degenerate meme coin slop. Fine. This extension uses the persona of Pickle Rick to analyze a GitHub repository or a Twitter profile of a crypto project. It runs a series of heuristic checks to determine how likely it is to be a worthless pile of garbage and then tells you exactly that.

This is for entertainment purposes. This is not financial advice. Don't be an idiot.
